# UTSA Challenge Module 1 

This challenge was a debug module where we worked with existing code to help clean up and optimize the SEO functions of the website in order for search engines to locate it more efficiently. Furthermore, also cleaning up a bit of the CSS classes in order for them to work off one rather them being split up into multiple classes.

understand what strategies to use in order to create a better webiste by reorganizing CSS tags.

Along adding more context to many of the <div> tags that were found throughout the website without changing
any of the contextual placement of the code.
